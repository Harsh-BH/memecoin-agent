### 🖼️ 4. NFT Minting
- After generating a meme, the bot asks **“Do you want to mint this meme as an NFT?”**  
- If you choose **“Yes, mint NFT,”** it calls `nft_mint` with the meme prompt as metadata.  
- You can also manually call `/nft_mint <metadata>` to mint an NFT with any arbitrary metadata.

### 🤖 5. AI Blockchain Chatbot
- If the user sends a normal message (not starting with `"/"`), the bot calls `getBlockchainAnswer(text)` to respond with a **blockchain-related** answer.  
- If the query isn’t blockchain-related, it politely declines.

## 🚀 Usage

### 🎯 Telegram Bot
Start a chat with the bot on Telegram and use commands:
```bash
/mint 10000000000000000  # Mint 0.01 NEAR tokens
/balance myaccount.testnet  # Check balance
/meme cat in a spacesuit  # Generate a meme
/startGame  # Start the mini-game
```

📩 **The bot sends you the meme image and asks if you want to mint it as an NFT.**  
If you say **“Yes,”** it calls `nft_mint` with that meme’s prompt as metadata.  
If you type a normal text message like **“What is blockchain consensus?”**, the bot calls the AI Q&A function.
